				<h3>About Pandora®</h3>

				<p>When was the last time you fell in love with a new artist or song?</p>

				<p>At Pandora, we have a single mission: To play only music you'll love. (OK, we've added comedy as well so we're also up for playing some jokes you'll love.)</p>

				<p>To understand just how we do this, and why we think we do it really, really well, you need to know about the <a href="http://www.pandora.com/about/mgp">Music Genome Project®</a>.</p>

				<p>Since we started back in 2000, we have been hard at work on the Music Genome Project. It's the most comprehensive analysis of music ever undertaken.</p>

				<p>Together our team of musician-analysts has been listening to music, one song at a time, studying and collecting literally hundreds of musical details
                on every track - melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics ... and more! We continue this work every day to keep up with the incredible
                flow of great new music coming from studios, stadiums and garages around the country.</p>

				<p>With Pandora you can explore this vast trove of music to your heart's content. Just drop the name of one of your favorite songs, artists or genres into
                Pandora and let the Music Genome Project go. It will quickly scan its entire world of analyzed music, almost a century of popular recordings - new and old,
                well known and completely obscure - to find songs with interesting musical similarities to your choice. Then sit back and enjoy as it creates a listening
                experience full of current and soon-to-be favorite songs for you.</p>

				<p>You can create up to 100 unique "stations." And you can even refine them. If it's not quite right you can tell it so and it will get better for you.</p>

				<p>The Music Genome Project was founded by musicians and music-lovers. We believe in the value of music and have a profound respect for those who create it.
                We like all kinds of music, from the most obtuse bebop, to the most tripped-out drum n bass, to the simplest catchy pop tune. Our mission is to help you
                connect with the music YOU love.</p>

				<p>We hope you enjoy the experience!</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>About Our Name</h3>

				<p>The name Pandora means "all gifted" in Greek. In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora received many gifts from the gods, including the gift of music, from
                Apollo. She was also, as we all know, very curious. Unlike those gods of old, however, we celebrate that virtue and have made it our mission to reward the
                musically curious among us with a never-ending experience of music discovery.</p>
